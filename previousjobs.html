        <h1>Previous Jobs</h1>
        <p>
          As the title might suggest, this page is about my previous jobs.<br />
          I can keep this list rather short actually..<br />
          I studied Sports and Wellness, have diploma's that are sports related
          only.<br />And so I've basically only worked as a
          <strong>Personal Trainer</strong>.<br />
          Besides working as a personal trainer, I used to play Rugby at the
          highest level in The Netherlands at Rugby Club Hilversum.<br />
          But unfortunately I severely injured my back in 2016 during a rugby
          match.<br />Now working as a personal trainer and playing rugby is not
          possible anymore due to back problems..<br />It's time to learn
          something new, like coding!
